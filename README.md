# TCDb Enhancerizer

This is a userscript that enhances the functionality of the TCDb website. At the moment it specifically adds prices to your Transactions so you can get a better idea of pricing for any given trade.

## Installation

1. To use userscripts, you need an appropriate extension. I recommend [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net), which is compeltely free.
2. Then you need to [download the userscript](https://github.com/Shpigford/tcdb-enhancerizer/raw/main/script.user.js) and the extension will automatically offer you to install it.
